Today was a very exciting day for everyone here at MSJ's CS Club because it was the first meeting of the 2022-2023 school year! Many many new faces gathered to learn more about the club and the new structural changes to the curriculum of it.

First, all of the officers of the club introduced themselves, and explained that the club would teach topics such as:
    - DSA, programming practices, cybersecurity, low-level programming, etc. 
    - Guest lectures
    - Practice problems in between 
    - Coding workshops 
    - Occasional CP competitions
    - ACSL
    - Practical coding (e.g. making websites, games, apps) 


Next, they informed of the new partnerships between
    - Hack Club, which allows the club to gives us a more practical coding focused curriculum (things like making an app or a website)
    - Competitive Programming Initiative, to teach more about things like data structures, algorithms, and all those good problem solving skillsets!

Finally, Pratyay told everyone about the different coding environments they could use, like VSCode, Doom Emacs, and Neovim (with Lunar to make it a good IDE).

And that pretty much wraps it up for the first meeting!
